# hashes and arrays
Array is one of the most powerful classes in Ruby and a very fundamental component of Game Toolkit.

An Array is an ordered, integer-indexed collection of objects, called elements. Any object (even another array) may be an array element, and an array can contain objects of different types.

Arrays in ruby are dynamic.

A Hash has certain similarities to an Array, but:
An Array index is always an Integer.
A Hash key can be (almost) any object.




**hash
*array
  # These are splat operators, they'll deconstruct your hash/array into arguments for a method. 

# destructure
array = [10, 20]
x, y = array # destructuring here is position based

# using spread (reverse splat?) for remaining
player = [5, 5, "Player 1", 5, 5] # x, y, name, w, h
player_x, player_y, name, *player_size = player # 5, 5, Player 1, [5, 5]

# splat operator

## for args
target = { x: 50, y: 50 }
def move_to(x:, y:)
  # moves player to x, y
end
move_to(**target)
  # hash splat

target = [50, 50]
def move_to(x, y)
  # moves player to x, y
end
move_to(*target)
  # array splat

old_hash = { a: 1, b: 2 }
hash = { a: 5, **old_hash, b: 6 } # => { a: 1, b: 6 }
  # args replaced by order of precedence

old_array = [2, 3, 4 , 5]
array = [ 1, 2, *old_array, 5, 6] # => [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6]
  # not for arrays tho..

"hashsplat is useful for moments when ~'a lot of the things i want to output are similar'"


def greet(*names)
  names.each { |name| puts "Hello, #{name}!" }
end

greet("Alice", "Bob", "Carol") # Outputs: Hello, Alice! Hello, Bob! Hello, Carol!








## hashes
screen ||= {0, 0, 720, 1280} # error
screen ||= {x: 0, y: 0, h: 720, w: 1280} # hashes need keys


## arrays







# structs
Person = Struct.new(:name, :age, :job)
john = Person.new("John Doe", 30, "Engineer")
puts john.name, john.age, john.job
john.age = 31



Person = Struct.new(:name, :age) do
  def birthday
    self.age += 1
  end
end

john = Person.new("John", 30)
john.birthday
puts john.age  # Outputs: 31
  # can add methods?? so.. it's a class..?





# classes

## anonymous
ghost_class = Class.new do
  def hello
    "Hello from the ghost class!"
  end
end

obj = ghost_class.new
puts obj.hello  # Outputs: Hello from the ghost class!
  # ghost class aka eigenclass aka anonymous class
  
  
str = "hello"
def str.shout
  upcase + "!!!"
end
puts str.shout  # Outputs: HELLO!!!
  # singleton method (per-object basis)
  # wow... this is interesting, and made really really simple
  
  

## normal/declared
class MyClass
  class << self
    def class_method
      "This is a class method"
    end
  end
end

puts MyClass.class_method  # Outputs: This is a class method
  # singleton method
  
  
obj = "I'm unique" # can use any object..?
class << obj
  def unique_method
    "Unique method!"
  end
end

puts obj.unique_method  # Outputs: Unique method!
  # singleton class..! whoa.. 


class MyClass
  def self.class_method
    "I'm a class method"
  end

  private_class_method :class_method
end

if MyClass.method_defined?(:class_method)
  puts "Class method is defined"
else
  puts "Class method is not accessible"
end
  # so there are private methods..





# everything in an object  
**methods defined at the "top level" are defined as instance methods on Object, so they're inherited by everything.** The top-level context itself is a special instance of Object called "main"; by defining these methods with self., they become singleton methods of that top-level context (which is where DR looks for them), and they are not inherited by every other object in the system.

The "surprising outcome" is specifically that Object ends up being the owner of these methods, the effect is that you can call add with an implicit receiver (as in within an object), but that Object.new.add(4, 6), and [].add(4, 6), and Module.add(4, 6), and $gtk.add(4, 6) all also work.

def tick
  # ...
end
  # if on the top-level context, will be inherited by *everything*
  # use self to avoid this:

def self.tick
  # ...
end








# from getting started tutorial
   
args.outputs.labels << [580, 400, 'Hello World!']
  # The "<<" thing says "append this array onto the list of them at args.outputs.labels)
  
args.state.rotation ||= 0
  # shorthand for "if args.state.rotation isn't initialized, set it to zero." It's a nice way to embed your initialization code right next to where you need the variable.
  #  - amazing..!

args.state.laser.trash ||= true
  # nested field mades on-the-fly..?



# loops
# loops are quite different..
array = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
array.each do |char|
  puts char
end  

array.each do |char, i|
  puts "index #{i}: #{char}"
end

3.times do |i|
  puts i
end

(0...4).each do |i|
  puts i
end
  # range block exclusive (three dots), excluding last number
  # 0-3, 4 matches the number of elements in an array

(0..3).each do |i|
  puts i
end
  # range block inclusive (two dots), including last number
  # 0-3
